/**
 * @class
 * This namespace contains functionality associated with creating your own content inside Gmail or Inbox. It allows you to define "Routes"
 * which define a full page of content and an associated URL space for which they are active. You can think of routes as different pages
 * in your application. Gmail and Inbox already have a few routes built in (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc). This namespace allows you to define
 * your own as well as listen in on the built in routes being navigated to.
 *
 * This is typically used when you want to create content to fill the main content area of Gmail or Inbox.
 *
 * Every route has a URL associated with it and can have optional parameters. However, you never construct these URL's manually.
 * The SDK will take care of creating a URL that will work in Gmail/Inbox for your Route. Since these URL's may change due to
 * implementations of Gmail/Inbox, you should always create new links when trying to set URL on elements or simply use the goto
 * function which naviagtes to the created link automatically.
 *
 * Using the {handleX} family of methods, you can specify which routes your application can handle. You will be called back with
 * and instance of a RouteView or similar when the user navigates to a route you've declared you can handle. For custom routes, you'll typically
 * add your own content and for built in routes, you'll typically modify the existing content.
 *
 * Route ID's are path like strings with named parameters, for example: "myroute/:someParamMyRouteNeeds".
