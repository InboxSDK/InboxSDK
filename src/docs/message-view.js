 *
 * A messages' view state can be one of {MessageViewViewStates.EXPANDED}, {MessageViewViewStates.COLLAPSED} or {MessageViewViewStates.HIDDEN}.

 * The load state of a message determines whether all of the data pertaining to a message has been loaded in the UI.
 * In some case, not all the information (such as recipients or the body) may be loaded, typically when the the view
 * state is {COLLAPSED} or {HIDDEN}. You should not depend on any relationship between the view state and load state. Instead,
 * use the provided {MessageView.getViewState()} and {MessageView.isLoaded()} methods.
