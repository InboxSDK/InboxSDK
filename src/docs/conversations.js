/**
 * @class
 * This namespace allows you to interact with Gmail and Inbox conversations (typically called threads). The fundamental
 * views you interact with are ThreadView and MessageView and there is a 1 to many relationship between them. The functions
 * in Conversations.* allow you to obtain these views which you can then further manipulate.
 *
 * It's important to note that ThreadViews and MessageViews can be navigated to in various ways by the user depending on their
 * email client and their settings (i.e. preview pane on in Gmail). This is abstracted completely away from you so you can just
 * focus on manipulating the views once they are given to you.
 *
 * Finally, when a ThreadView loads, you're not guranteed that every MessageView in it is also loaded. When you call
 * ThreadView.getMessageViews it will return all MessageViews, but its important to remember that the MessageViews might not
 * be loaded. MessageViews can be in several states. Consult the {MessageView} documentation to learn about what
 * functionality is available in each state.
