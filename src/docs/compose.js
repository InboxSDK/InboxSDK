/**
 * @class
 * This namespace contains methods and types related to adding your application elements to the Gmail or Inbox Compose UI.
 * The compose UI has two variants. The New Compose UI appears when users are composing new messages and appear as windows
 * above the rest of the app content. The second, the Reply UI, appears when users are replying to existing messages
 * from the message they are replying to. This namespace handles both of these variants equivalently.
 *
 * The {ComposeView} type is how you interact with compose windows in Gmail and Inbox. The most common way to get
 * access to a compose view is to use the {Compose.registerComposeViewHandler()} method which calls you back
 * with every existing {ComposeView} and all future {ComposeView}s. From there a typical application will
 * modify the {ComposeView} as needed by adding buttons, adding content to the message, or accessing the recipient data.

   * This function returns a function which removes the handler registration.
