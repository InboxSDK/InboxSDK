 * NavItemsViews are the elements placed inside a NavMenu. Each NavItemView

 * Typically the main action of a NavItemView is performed when the user clicks on the
 * main text. However, you can also provide accessories which are secondary actions which
 * typically appear on the right side of the NavItemView but may be rendered in other ways.
 *
 * For nested NavItemViews, the SDK will handle collapsing and expanding children depending
 * on user input.
